<para>It is possible that a stream buffer will have a task blocked on it waiting for space to become available. Calling <ref refid="stream__buffer_8h_1a6c882a1d9f26c40f93f271bd1b844b3b" kindref="member">xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR()</ref> can make space available, and so cause a task that is waiting for space to leave the Blocked state. If calling <ref refid="stream__buffer_8h_1a6c882a1d9f26c40f93f271bd1b844b3b" kindref="member">xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR()</ref> causes a task to leave the Blocked state, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently executing task (the task that was interrupted), then, internally, <ref refid="stream__buffer_8h_1a6c882a1d9f26c40f93f271bd1b844b3b" kindref="member">xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR()</ref> will set *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE. If <ref refid="stream__buffer_8h_1a6c882a1d9f26c40f93f271bd1b844b3b" kindref="member">xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR()</ref> sets this value to pdTRUE, then normally a context switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited. That will ensure the interrupt returns directly to the highest priority Ready state task. *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken should be set to pdFALSE before it is passed into the function. See the code example below for an example.</para>

    // priority of the currently executing task was unblocked and a context
    // switch should be performed to ensure the ISR returns to the unblocked
    // task.  In most FreeRTOS ports this is done by simply passing
    // xHigherPriorityTaskWoken into taskYIELD_FROM_ISR(), which will test the
    // variables value, and perform the context switch if necessary.  Check the
    // documentation for the port in use for port specific instructions.
