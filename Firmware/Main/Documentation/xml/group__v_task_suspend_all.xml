<para>Suspends the scheduler without disabling interrupts. Context switches will not occur while the scheduler is suspended.</para>
<para>After calling vTaskSuspendAll () the calling task will continue to execute without risk of being swapped out until a call to xTaskResumeAll () has been made.</para>
<para>API functions that have the potential to cause a context switch (for example, <ref refid="task_8h_1a067da3e949e248096ec6c01f9cb75a47" kindref="member">vTaskDelayUntil()</ref>, <ref refid="queue_8h_1af7eb49d3249351176992950d9185abe9" kindref="member">xQueueSend()</ref>, etc.) must not be called while the scheduler is suspended.</para>

     // Prevent the real time kernel swapping out the task.

     // sections as we have all the microcontroller processing time.
     // During this time interrupts will still operate and the kernel
     // tick count will be maintained.

     // The operation is complete.  Restart the kernel.
