<parameterdescription>
<para>A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to set. For example, to set bit 3 only, set uxBitsToSet to 0x08. To set bit 3 and bit 0 set uxBitsToSet to 0x09.</para>

<simplesect kind="return"><para>The value of the event group at the time the call to <ref refid="event__groups_8h_1a02d7b3bb55f7e11d9c47116266c5fb2e" kindref="member">xEventGroupSetBits()</ref> returns. There are two reasons why the returned value might have the bits specified by the uxBitsToSet parameter cleared. First, if setting a bit results in a task that was waiting for the bit leaving the blocked state then it is possible the bit will be cleared automatically (see the xClearBitOnExit parameter of <ref refid="event__groups_8h_1aab9d5b405bc57b7624dcabe9a9a503db" kindref="member">xEventGroupWaitBits()</ref>). Second, any unblocked (or otherwise Ready state) task that has a priority above that of the task that called <ref refid="event__groups_8h_1a02d7b3bb55f7e11d9c47116266c5fb2e" kindref="member">xEventGroupSetBits()</ref> will execute and may change the event group value before the call to <ref refid="event__groups_8h_1a02d7b3bb55f7e11d9c47116266c5fb2e" kindref="member">xEventGroupSetBits()</ref> returns.</para>
