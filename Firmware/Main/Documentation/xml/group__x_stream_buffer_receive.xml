<para>Receives bytes from a stream buffer.</para>
<para><emphasis><bold>NOTE</bold></emphasis>: Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream buffer implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader). It is safe for the writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other FreeRTOS objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or multiple different readers. If there are to be multiple different writers then the application writer must place each call to a writing API function (such as <ref refid="stream__buffer_8h_1a35cdf3b6bf677086b9128782f762499d" kindref="member">xStreamBufferSend()</ref>) inside a critical section and set the send block time to 0. Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers then the application writer must place each call to a reading API function (such as xStreamBufferRead()) inside a critical section and set the receive block time to 0.</para>

<parametername>xTicksToWait</parametername>
</parameternamelist>
<parameterdescription>
<para>The maximum amount of time the task should remain in the Blocked state to wait for data to become available if the stream buffer is empty. <ref refid="stream__buffer_8h_1a55efc144b988598d84a6087d3e20b507" kindref="member">xStreamBufferReceive()</ref> will return immediately if xTicksToWait is zero. The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro <ref refid="projdefs_8h_1a353d0f62b82a402cb3db63706c81ec3f" kindref="member">pdMS_TO_TICKS()</ref> can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time specified in ticks. Setting xTicksToWait to portMAX_DELAY will cause the task to wait indefinitely (without timing out), provided INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend is set to 1 in <ref refid="_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h" kindref="compound">FreeRTOSConfig.h</ref>. A task does not use any CPU time when it is in the Blocked state.</para>
