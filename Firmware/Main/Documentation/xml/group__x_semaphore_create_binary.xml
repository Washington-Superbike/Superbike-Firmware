<para>semphr. h <preformatted>SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphoreCreateBinary( void )</preformatted></para>
<para>Creates a new binary semaphore instance, and returns a handle by which the new semaphore can be referenced.</para>
<para>In many usage scenarios it is faster and more memory efficient to use a direct to task notification in place of a binary semaphore! <ulink url="http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html">http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html</ulink></para>
<para>Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, binary semaphores use a block of memory, in which the semaphore structure is stored. If a binary semaphore is created using xSemaphoreCreateBinary() then the required memory is automatically dynamically allocated inside the xSemaphoreCreateBinary() function. (see <ulink url="http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html">http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html</ulink>). If a binary semaphore is created using xSemaphoreCreateBinaryStatic() then the application writer must provide the memory. xSemaphoreCreateBinaryStatic() therefore allows a binary semaphore to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.</para>
<para>The old vSemaphoreCreateBinary() macro is now deprecated in favour of this xSemaphoreCreateBinary() function. Note that binary semaphores created using the vSemaphoreCreateBinary() macro are created in a state such that the first call to &apos;take&apos; the semaphore would pass, whereas binary semaphores created using xSemaphoreCreateBinary() are created in a state such that the the semaphore must first be &apos;given&apos; before it can be &apos;taken&apos;.</para>
<para>This type of semaphore can be used for pure synchronisation between tasks or between an interrupt and a task. The semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so one task/interrupt can continuously &apos;give&apos; the semaphore while another continuously &apos;takes&apos; the semaphore. For this reason this type of semaphore does not use a priority inheritance mechanism. For an alternative that does use priority inheritance see xSemaphoreCreateMutex().</para>
<para><simplesect kind="return"><para>Handle to the created semaphore, or NULL if the memory required to hold the semaphore&apos;s data structures could not be allocated.</para>
</simplesect>
Example usage: <preformatted>
SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;

void vATask( void * pvParameters )
{
   // Semaphore cannot be used before a call to xSemaphoreCreateBinary().
   // This is a macro so pass the variable in directly.
   xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateBinary();

   if( xSemaphore != NULL )
   {
       // The semaphore was created successfully.
       // The semaphore can now be used.
   }
}
