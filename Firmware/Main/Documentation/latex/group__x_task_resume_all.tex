Resumes scheduler activity after it was suspended by a call to \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a366b302eba79d10b5ee2a3756f0fcc43}{v\+Task\+Suspend\+All()}}.

\mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a003f8ae6d649225abd030cc76e1c7d0e}{x\+Task\+Resume\+All()}} only resumes the scheduler. It does not unsuspend tasks that were previously suspended by a call to \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a84d4e660b04630be2939d91b3c2412f8}{v\+Task\+Suspend()}}.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If resuming the scheduler caused a context switch then pd\+TRUE is returned, otherwise pd\+FALSE is returned.

     // Task code goes here.

     // ...

     // At some point the task wants to perform a long operation during
     // which it does not want to get swapped out.  It cannot use
     // taskENTER\_CRITICAL ()/taskEXIT\_CRITICAL () as the length of the
     // operation may cause interrupts to be missed -\/ including the
     // ticks.

     // Prevent the real time kernel swapping out the task.
     vTaskSuspendAll ();

     // Perform the operation here.  There is no need to use critical
     // sections as we have all the microcontroller processing time.
     // During this time interrupts will still operate and the real
     // time kernel tick count will be maintained.

     // ...

     // The operation is complete.  Restart the kernel.  We want to force
     // a context switch -\/ but there is no point if resuming the scheduler
     // caused a context switch already.
